- Gautefall and Rauland ski resorts have installed fast chargers for winter guests to recharge their electric vehicles.
- The mobile fast chargers are a solution that saves the need for large charging facilities in destinations with high seasonal demand.
- The chargers are moved to coastal areas or other locations with high activity in the summer, such as campgrounds and festivals.
- The pilot project received positive feedback and the payment solution for customers is a regular card reader.
- By 2025, all construction sites in the transportation sector in major cities must operate without fossil fuel energy.
- Skagerak Energis introduced a pilot project for mobile energy at emission-free construction sites, allowing electric construction machines to be charged outside the power grid.
- Skagerak Energi has four charging containers with batteries and enough capacity to charge an electric machine with 360 kW per outlet.
- Skagerak Kraft AS has established a new company, Skagerak Energitjenester AS, to meet the increasing need for management, storage, and optimization of renewable energy sources.
- Low water levels in reservoirs due to low precipitation affected outdoor activities and resulted in high electricity prices.
- The low water levels affected not only Skagerak Kraft's reservoirs but also other major reservoirs in South Norway.
