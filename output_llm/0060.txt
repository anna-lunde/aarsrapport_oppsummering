- For extensive power development by 2030, only three options are considered: solar, offshore wind, and onshore wind.
- Norway's first solar power park was operational in 2022, with expectations for more in the future.
- Optimistic estimates for offshore wind point to Utsira Nord in 2028, but this might be overly ambitious.
- As a result, onshore wind power remains the primary alternative.
- The processing of wind power concessions resumed after a three-year hiatus, allowing for new applications.
- The government aims to strengthen the role of municipalities in wind power planning and development on land.
- In addition to climate goals, authorities and industry have ambitions to capture Norway's share of emerging green industries.
- Concrete plans exist for battery factories, data centers, and large-scale hydrogen production across the country.
- This industry demands significant power and increases the need for renewable production.
- The size of the green industry will determine the extent of necessary power development in Norway.
- A surplus of affordable and stable electric power should remain a competitive advantage for Norwegian businesses.
- If the current national surplus of approximately 15 TWh per year disappears in four years, Norway will become dependent on imports for extended periods.
- Significant price fluctuations throughout the year will become the new norm due to the increasing amount of unregulated solar and wind production in neighboring countries.
- Power grid development must align with increased production, as reported by utility companies experiencing high demand associated with establishing new green industries.
- Resolving this complex issue is crucial for a successful green transition.
