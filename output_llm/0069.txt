- Skagerak Energi will base their reporting on the guidelines and standards available for the industry.
- For the year 2022, Skagerak Energi used the industry collaboration through Fornybar Norge and their industry guide "Veileder: Krav i taksonomien for vannkraft".
- Skagerak Energi will monitor the development of the EU's taxonomy framework and adjust accordingly. This may affect their assessment of taxonomy-adapted activities and reporting of performance indicators in the future.
- EU's taxonomy is a classification system for sustainable economic activities, aimed at establishing objective criteria, managing private capital towards sustainable projects, and fulfilling EU's green transition goals.
- To be classified as sustainable, an activity must significantly contribute to at least one of the six environmental goals, not cause significant harm to the other environmental goals, and meet minimum requirements for social standards.
- The activity should also align with social responsibility and sustainability.
