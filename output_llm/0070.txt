- Skagerak Energi has reported its financial indicators for the fiscal year 2022 in accordance with the EU taxonomy regulations.
- The report includes the percentage of activities that align with the taxonomy requirements and those that do not, measured by net operating income, investments, and operating costs.
- Skagerak Energi's main environmental goal is to combat climate change.
- The company has identified the economic activities that fall under the taxonomy definition for combating climate change.
- The report focuses on the electricity production from hydropower, primarily the power plants where Skagerak Kraft is the majority owner and included in the consolidated financial statements.
- The electricity production from the Skollenborg power plant and power plants in the Otravassdraget, where Skagerak Kraft is a minority owner with no operational responsibility, is not included in the 2022 report due to incomplete taxonomy mapping. It will be included in the 2023 report.
- The taxonomy covers six environmental goals: combating climate change, climate adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, prevention and control of pollution, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.
