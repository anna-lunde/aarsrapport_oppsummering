- Laugstol on Enger-field in Porsgrunn has signed a new contract with net company Lede, leading to an increase in electric vehicles on the premises.
- Kagerak Energi and Lede have implemented a requirement for increased use of fossil-free fuel in all transportation-related acquisitions.
- The market responded positively to the challenge and Laugstol, Laje, and Nettpartner now use fossil-free vehicles for many of their assignments for Lede.
- Lede wants to be a predictable customer who involves the supplier in meeting the requirements, with a gradual implementation process.
- Laugstol committed to completing 50% of their assignments using renewable energy in the first year, increasing to 70% in the next few years.
- Lede aims to learn from suppliers' experiences, as other public entities are also starting to require fossil-free transport from their suppliers.
- Challenges with electric vehicles include reduced battery capacity in winter, which may require more charging infrastructure and the use of containers to reduce heavy hauling.
- Multiple factors are considered in new procurement processes, including range, loading capacity, and the ability to demand fossil-free transport.
- Lede aims to contribute to a zero-emission society by setting consistent requirements for its suppliers.
- Trygg Partner focuses on safety culture, availability, delivery security, flexibility, diversity, learning organization, responsibility in all aspects, human rights, anti-corruption, collaboration and requirements for suppliers, and humanitarian and social engagement.
