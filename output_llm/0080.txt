- Increased renewable energy production and Norwegian hydroelectric power production contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
- Skagerak Energy's production and distribution of electricity from renewable hydroelectric power and district heating contribute to reduced CO2 emissions.
- Skagerak Energy produced 3986 GWh of electricity in 2022, resulting in reduced emissions compared to coal or gas power plants.
- Skagerak Energy's district heating production resulted in a net reduction of over 35,000 tonnes of CO2 compared to oil heating.
- Total emissions (scope 1-3) in 2022 were 2742 tonnes of CO2-equivalents.
- In 2022, the CO2 emissions per kWh of energy produced by Skagerak Energy was 0.7 grams, compared to coal power plants (approximately 1000 grams per kWh) and gas power plants (approximately 500 grams per kWh).
- Good waste sorting and treatment practices contribute to resource reuse.
- Hydroelectric power, combined with wind and solar power, provides flexibility and increased delivery reliability.
- Regulation of water reservoirs also serves as an important flood prevention measure during periods of heavy rainfall.
- Hydroelectric power production has minimal greenhouse gas emissions but has environmental consequences, which are mitigated through systematic environmental management and mitigating measures.
- Skagerak Energy prioritizes responsible and knowledge-based management of its facilities and continuously works to reduce negative environmental impacts.
